				target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java</a>. It is available as <a href="https://www.eclipse.org"
				target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse</a> plugin and as a stand-alone application for
			Windows, Linux, and macOS using <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt" target="_blank"

		<ul>
			<li>Support for very large files</li>

			<li>Undo/redo</li>
			<li>English and German screen texts</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Download and Installation</h2>
		<p id="version">You need to have Java 1.8 or newer installed to use the program. There are different options to
			run <em>javahexeditor</em> :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For <b>Linux</b> users, there is a <a
					href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/javahexeditor/files/javahexeditor/current/javahexeditor-linux-x86_32.tar.gz/download">32-bit</a>
				version and a <a
					href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/javahexeditor/files/javahexeditor/current/javahexeditor-linux-x86_64.tar.gz/download">64-bit</a>
				version in the form of a shell script "JavaHexEditor" which embeds the "JavaHexEditor.jar". <br /> You
				can run it via the shell. To run it via double click on the desktop, you have to adapt the behavior
				preferences of "Files". <br /> <a href="images/linux-files-preferences.png" target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"> <img src="images/linux-files-preferences.png"
						alt="Preferences for executable text files" width="320" /> </a></li>
			<li>For <b>macOS</b> users there is a <a
					href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/javahexeditor/files/javahexeditor/current/javahexeditor-macosx-x86_32.tar.gz/download">32-bit</a>
				version and a <a

				version in the form of a native ".app" version. Note that you have to have the Java <i>JDK</i> installed
				and not only the <i>JRE</i> , because on Mac OS X the JRE is only installed as a browser plugin and not
				as Java runtime.</li>
			<li>For <b>Windows</b> users, there is a <a
					href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/javahexeditor/files/javahexeditor/current/javahexeditor-win32-x86_32.zip/download">32-bit</a>
				version and a <a
					href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/javahexeditor/files/javahexeditor/current/javahexeditor-win32-x86_64.zip/download">64-bit</a>
				version in the form of a single executable file named "JavaHexEditor.exe".</li>

		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<h3>Eclipse Editor</h3>
		Any file currently in the workspace (but not part of a jar file) with one of the extensions listed below can be
		opened with <em>javahexeditor</em> by right-clicking on the file name, expanding the "Open With" menu item, and
		selecting <em>javahexeditor</em> : <br /> <code>a, bin, cab, class, com, dat, data, drv, dll, exe, hex, iso,
			jar, lib, o, out, part, pdf, png, ram, res, rom, sys, txt, zip
		</code> . <br /> Other file extensions can be added in the preferences dialog via "Window / Preferences... /
		General / Editors / File Associations".
		<h3>Stand-alone Editor</h3>
		<p>The standalone editor comes with its own main window and menu bar. All important menu items are bound to a
			standard keyboard shortcut. The keyboard shortcut is displayed in the respective menu item. You can use the
			"File / Open File..." (CTRL-O) menu item to open a file or drag the file you want to open and drop it inside
			the editor area. To start editing a new file from scratch using the "File / New" (CTRL-N) menu item.</p>
		<p>You can also specify the file to edit as a command line parameter for the "JavaHexEditor.exe" executable or
			the "JavaHexEditor.sh" shell start script.</p>
		<h3>Browsing the File Content</h3>
		<p>You can move around the file as you would in any other text editor. To change from hex to text, or vice
			versa, press the [Tab] key or click the mouse in the appropriate area.</p>
		<p>To locate a specific position within the file use the Goto dialog. The dialog can be opened via the menu item
			"Edit / Go to Location.." (CTRL-L). This kind of positioning is especially useful when editing very big
			files and the scroll bar is not accurate enough.</p>
		<p>To select text move the cursor to the selection start and then press the SHIFT key when changing the cursor
			to the selection end.</p>
		<h3>Editing the File Content</h3>
		<p>There are two modify modes: insert and overwrite. You can switch between insert/overwrite modes with the
			INSERT key in your keyboard (as in some text editors, for instance).</p>
		<p>You can insert/delete/trim bytes in insert mode only. In overwrite mode the file length never changes and you
			cannot paste things bigger than the space left in the file.</p>
		<p>You can insert other files by copying them to the clipboard. This can be achieved for example via "Edit /
			Copy" (CTRL-C) in Windows and pasting it in <em>javahexeditor</em> via "Edit / Paste" (CTRL-V). Copying to a
			text editor has a limit of 4 MB. Binary copying (from <em>javahexeditor</em> to <em>javahexeditor</em> ) is
			limited by the free disk space only.</p>
		<p>Modified text is displayed in blue, so it is easier to see the changes made to the file.</p>
		<h2>Screen Shots</h2>

		application looks like. Here the block selection dialog is currently open. <br /> <img
